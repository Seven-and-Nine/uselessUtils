Useless Utilities will bring many strange but somewhat useless utilities to Minecraft. An example would be to finally compress regular things into something easy for portable vanilla storage. Compress Flint down into a block, or hyper-compress it into an ingot and make tools with it! Most Hyper compressed tools do nothing other than provide tight storage options. This includes but is not limited to Sticks, that may be able to be hyper compressed into ingots using other organic materials. With hyper-compression you can 1) Compress them further into decorative blocks for building or block storage . 2) If unable to use hyper-compressed ingots into tools, or decorative blocks, they are only purposeful for storage/transport. That should cover everything for general information.
